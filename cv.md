## Briefly about myself
I always have been internet enthusiast since childhood. I have always been fascinated by the process of creating something on my own, whether it is website design, front-end code or a picture in Photoshop. Thus I got the motivation and incentive to start coding. I am a reliable and friendly person myself. I always try to think critically and look for an approach to the problem from different sides and angles.
